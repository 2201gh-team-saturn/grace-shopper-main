# Establishing Norms

## Roles
* Task manager
  - Responsible for reviewing that each feature meets all requirements upon pull request submission
* Project Manager
  - Responsible for managing the timing of our project, ensuring timeliness is at the forefront of what we're doing
* Request manager
  - Responsible for reviewing/approving pull requests
* Worker Bee
  - Responsible for working through assigned tasks, a day to focus on the tasks at hand with less on your plate
  - Investigator, if someone is having trouble and experiencing a bug this person is the first line of defense

## Daily process
* Morning standup at 11:15AM EST/8:15AM PST started by yesterday's Task Manager 
  - New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Task manager)
  - Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Task manager)
* Pair program on assigned tasks
* Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
* Bring up any blocking issues after 15-20 minutes of spinning your wheels. Worker Bee will be the first responder, but anyone who's available can come join debugging session.
* At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
* We don't merge except for once a day to main branch
* Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into main


## Team expectations
* Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
* We plan on taking a break on Sunday to get the rest we deserve
* If a group member plans on working off hours, or feels inspired, they'll send a quick heads up so everyone is on the same page
* We expect that no one will merge the main branch until we have had a code review, or we have discussed the newly added functionality (this will happen once a day)
* Anytime we get frustrated, be it our own code or during a discussion in a tense decision making stage, we take a 5 min breather then regroup
* Come to stand-up with root cause of any issues or bugs we've run into, with a quick what happened, where, why and how to avoid going forward
* If you're taking a break during working hours, you send a message to the slack channel to let us know you'll be unavailable
* We'll keep the paired programming sessions fluid and open to personal interpretation. People switch when they feel like they've reached a good stopping point

### Disagreements
Steps to reach an agreement: 
1. Everyone says their piece about what direction they believe we should go, we have a conversation to start to see if we can get on the same page
2. If no agreement can be reached, or we're at a stalemate, then it goes up to a vote. We explain why we voted that way and why we feel strongly about it so hopefully no one feels hurt or left out of the decision
3. If residual feelings or thoughts exist and we still can't reach an agreement, we'll escalate to Rusty
